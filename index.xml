Installing Hermit Installing Hermit is straightforward:
curl -fsSL https://github.com/cashapp/hermit/releases/download/stable/install.sh | /bin/bash This will download and install hermit into ~/bin. You should add this to your $PATH if it isn't already.
Also consider installing the shell hooks to get automatic environment activation/deactivation when changing directories. Initialising a Project Change into a project directory and run the following:</description></item><item><title>Environment variables</title><link>https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/usage/envars/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/usage/envars/</guid><description>When a Hermit environment is active, environment variables will be set by Hermit itself, the command-line, the active environment, and installed packages, in that order.
Hermit Hermit prefixes all of its own variables with HERMIT_ or _HERMIT_. While it uses a bunch of variables internally, two you can rely on to always be present in an active environment are:
Name Description HERMIT_ENV Path to the active Hermit environment.</description></item><item><title>Package management</title><link>https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/usage/management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/usage/management/</guid><description>This document describes how packages within a Hermit environment can be found, installed, and managed. Packages are defined in configuration files called manifests which are retrieved from collections of manifests called manifest sources which in turn are commonly (but not always) Git repositories.
Keeping up to Date Hermit retrieves package manifests from various locations, including Git repositories. It will periodically sync these repositories to your system to ensure you have the most up to date manifests, but you may also force this by running:</description></item><item><title>Recipes / Patterns</title><link>https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/usage/recipes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/usage/recipes/</guid><description>Patterns for solving common problems.
Pin to a major or minor version Reusing shell scripts across multiple projects Shell script &amp;quot;libraries&amp;quot; Pin to a major or minor version Each Hermit package includes a @latest channel, which is the latest stable version. One downside to this is that if a new major version is released, potentially including breaking changes, Hermit will use that as the version.</description></item><item><title>Editor / IDE Integration</title><link>https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/usage/ide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/usage/ide/</guid><description>JetBrains - IntelliJ, GoLand Due to the way JetBrains IDE plugin APIs are designed, specific support for each language has to be built into the plugin. Currently, only the JDK and Go are supported. To install the plugin, search for the &amp;quot;Hermit&amp;quot; plugin from the Plugin Marketplace in the IDE Preferences &amp;gt; Plugin view, and install it.
When you open a Hermit managed project, a dialog is shown asking if you want to enable the plugin for the project.</description></item><item><title>Shell Integration</title><link>https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/usage/shell/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/usage/shell/</guid><description>Tracking Environment Variables When a Hermit environment is activated, Hermit will install a shell hook to keep your shell's environment variables synchronised with Hermit's environment variables as you add and remove packages. This hook executes prior to each command.
Shell Hooks Hermit can also install shell integration hooks to provide
Automatic environment activation / deactivation of Hermit environments as you change directories in your terminal.</description></item><item><title>Configuration</title><link>https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/usage/config/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/usage/config/</guid><description>Each Hermit environment contains a bin/hermit.hcl file that can be used to customise that Hermit environment.

GitHub Actions Using Hermit in GitHub Actions is straightforward. Just add the following step to each job:
- name:Init Hermitrun:./bin/hermit env --raw &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $GITHUB_ENVeg.

To that end, Hermit will check for and upgrade to new releases of itself once every 24 hours, and will sync to the latest package definitions every 24 hours. If you notice a pause when using Hermit, this is often the cause.
You can read more about the implications of this on package maintenance in the packaging introduction.</description></item><item><title>Tutorial</title><link>https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/packaging/tutorial/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/packaging/tutorial/</guid><description>For this tutorial we're going to package up jq, a supremely useful tool for filtering and transforming JSON.
Writing package manifests for Hermit should be fairly familiar to anyone who has had experience with package managers like Homebrew, though it should be significantly more straightforward assuming the package provides cross-platform binaries for download.
This tutorial covers a fairly simple package definition, but more complex examples exist such as graalvm. Please refer to the hermit-packages repository for many more examples.</description></item><item><title>Reference</title><link>https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/packaging/reference/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/packaging/reference/</guid><description>Update Policy Hermit syncs manifest sources every 24 hours from HEAD. Because any changes are then immediately reflected in active environments, care must be taken to maintain backwards compatibility.
In particular this means:
Never delete or rename versions. Take care when updating environment variables. And in general think carefully about what impact your change will have if it is applied to an active environment.
Manifests Hermit manifests (package definitions) are HCL configuration files defining where to download packages from and how to install them.</description></item><item><title>Private Packages</title><link>https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/packaging/private/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/packaging/private/</guid><description>Custom Hermit Hermit has a configurable command-line entry point which can be useful if you need to use a custom HTTP client in order to access your private packages or manifest sources. See the hermit main package for an example of how this is used.
This can be used to specify a custom set of sources, and other configuration, for your org.
Private Channel If you ship your own version of Hermit you must choose a unique channel name (typically your oganisation's name), eg.</description></item><item><title>&lt;manifest>.hcl</title><link>https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/packaging/schema/manifest/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/packaging/schema/manifest/</guid><description>Each Hermit package manifest is a nested structure containing OS/architecture-specific configuration.
